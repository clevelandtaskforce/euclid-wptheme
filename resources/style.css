Description:        Euclid is the new face of the AIDS Taskforce of Greater Cleveland. It's name represents a double-entendre of the organization's current and historical homes along Cleveland's Euclid Corridor as well as an homage to Euclid, the father of geometry and the underlying mathematics that serve as the foundation for this new, cleaner look for the ATGC.
